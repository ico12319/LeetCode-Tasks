# LeetCode_Tasks

These are tasks I have solved for practice over the time from the LeetCode site. Most of the problems are solved using C++ language and are mostly linked with 
Data Structure and Algorithms.

The main data types in the problems are:
1. Vector
2. String
3. Stack
4. Queue
5. Linked Lists(Singly and Doubly)
6. Binary Trees
7. N-ary Trees
8. Binary Search Trees
9. Graphs(BFS, DFS)
10. Graphs shortest path(BFS,Dijkstra)
11. Hash Tables and Hash Sets
13. Priority Queue (Min & Max heap)
14. Sorting Algorithms
15. AVL Trees (Set & Map)
