The repository is structured as follows:
Each problem has its own folder named after the LeetCode problem number.
Inside each folder, you'll find:
-main.cpp â€“ My C++/C# solution for the problem.

Data Structures Used:
Throughout my solutions, I utilize a variety of data structures depending on the problem. Here are some of the commonly used ones:
#Arrays: For storing and accessing sequential data.
#Hash Maps / Dictionaries: For constant time lookups and managing key-value pairs.
#Sets: To handle unique elements and perform efficient membership checks.
#Stacks: For problems involving last-in, first-out (LIFO) order.
#Queues: To maintain first-in, first-out (FIFO) order, useful in breadth-first search (BFS) problems.
#Linked Lists: When dynamic memory management and insertion are needed.
